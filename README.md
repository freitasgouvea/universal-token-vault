UniversalTokenVault is a versatile smart contract that allows users to deposit and withdraw various types of tokens (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 and Custom Tokens) with ease. This project aims to provide a unified interface for managing multiple token standards, ensuring security and flexibility.

> **Disclaimer:** This code is for testing purposes only. For now it is not recommended to use this in production, it is under development (WIP) and has not been audited. Use at your own risk.

## üåü Overview

UniversalTokenVault is designed to handle various token standards with custom function signatures for deposits and withdrawals. The contract maintains user balances and ownership of tokens, providing a flexible and secure solution for token management.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-token support:** Handle ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 and Custom Tokens.
- **Custom function signatures:** Store and verify function signatures for deposits and withdrawals.
- **Flexible parameter indexing:** Configure different parameter indices for each token type.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

- **ReentrancyGuard:** Prevents reentrancy attacks.
- **Pausable:** Allows the contract to be paused in case of emergencies.
- **Ownable:** Restricts certain functions to the contract owner.
- **Function Signature Verification:** Ensures that the registered token functions are correctly called.
- **Safe Deposit**: Validates and decodes the `msg.sender` and the address used in field `from` to only allow deposits from owner.
- **Safe Withdraw**: Validates and decodes the `msg.sender` and the address used in field `to` to only allow withdraws to owner.
- **Amount and/or Id Verification:** Validates and decodes the `amount` and `id` parameters for deposits and withdrawals.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) - Ethereum development environment
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UniversalTokenVault.git
   cd UniversalTokenVault
   ```

2. Compile the contracts:

   ```sh
   forge build
   ```

## üìú Smart Contract Structure

### Initialization

- `initialize()`: Initializes the vault, enabling it for use. This function can only be called once by the owner.

### Token Activation and Deactivation

- `activateToken(address _token, bool _hasAmount, bool _hasId, bytes4 _depositFunctionSignature, bytes4 _withdrawFunctionSignature, uint8 _fromParamIndexForDeposit, uint8 _amountParamIndexForDeposit, uint8 _idParamIndexForDeposit, uint8 _toParamIndexForWithdraw, uint8 _amountParamIndexForWithdraw, uint8 _idParamIndexForWithdraw)`: Registers a token in the vault with specific parameters.
  - `_token`: The address of the token to be activated.
  - `_hasAmount`: Indicates if the token has an amount parameter.
  - `_hasId`: Indicates if the token has an ID parameter.
  - `_depositFunctionSignature`: The function signature for deposit.
  - `_withdrawFunctionSignature`: The function signature for withdrawal.
  - `_fromParamIndexForDeposit`: The index of the from parameter for deposit.
  - `_amountParamIndexForDeposit`: The index of the amount parameter for deposit.
  - `_idParamIndexForDeposit`: The index of the ID parameter for deposit.
  - `_toParamIndexForWithdraw`: The index of the to parameter for withdrawal.
  - `_amountParamIndexForWithdraw`: The index of the amount parameter for withdrawal.
  - `_idParamIndexForWithdraw`: The index of the ID parameter for withdrawal.

- `deactivateToken(address _token)`: Deactivates a previously registered token, preventing further deposits and withdrawals.

### Deposit and Withdraw

- `deposit(address _token, bytes calldata _data)`: Allows users to deposit registered tokens into the vault. The function decodes the provided data to extract the amount and/or ID parameters as needed, updates the user's balance, and calls the specified deposit function on the token contract.
- `withdraw(address _token, bytes calldata _data)`: Allows users to withdraw tokens from the vault. The function decodes the provided data to extract the amount and/or ID parameters, checks the user's balance, updates the balance, and calls the specified withdraw function on the token contract.

### Helper Functions

- `_verifyFunctionSignature(bytes4 _storedSignature, bytes calldata _data)`: Compares the stored function signature with the calldata selector to verify the function being called.
- `_decodeAmount(bytes calldata _data, uint8 _paramIndex)`: Decodes the amount parameter from the provided data based on the specified parameter index.
- `_decodeId(bytes calldata _data, uint8 _paramIndex)`: Decodes the ID parameter from the provided data based on the specified parameter index.
- `_getRevertMsg(bytes memory _returnData)`: Extracts the revert reason from the return data of a failed call.

### View Functions

- `getUserTokenBalance(address _user, address _token)`: Returns the balance of a specific token for a user.
- `getOwnerOfTokenId(address _token, uint256 _id)`: Returns the owner of a specific token ID.
- `getUserBalanceOfTokenId(address _user, address _token, uint256 _id)`: Returns the balance of a specific token ID for a user.

### ERC1155 Receiver Functions

These functions are implemented to allow the vault to receive ERC1155 tokens directly:

- `onERC1155Received(...)`: Handles the receipt of single ERC1155 token transfers.
- `onERC1155BatchReceived(...)`: Handles the receipt of batch ERC1155 token transfers.

## üß™ Running Tests

1. Compile the smart contract:
    ```bash
    forge build
    ```

2. Run tests:
    ```bash
    forge test
    ```
    
## üßê Usage

To use the `UniversalTokenVault` contract, follow these steps:

1. **Deployment**: Deploy the contract and initialize it by calling the `initialize()` function.
2. **Token Registration**: Register the tokens you want to manage by calling the `activateToken()` function with the appropriate parameters.
3. **Deposits and Withdrawals**: Users can deposit tokens into the vault using the `deposit()` function and withdraw tokens using the `withdraw()` function.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Scripts

To deploy and test the UniversalTokenVault contract using Foundry, follow these steps:

### 1. Deploy the Vault Contract

```sh
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url chain-rpc-url --private-key your-private-key --broadcast
```

### 2. Deploy and Register Tokens

```sh
forge script script/RegisterTokens.s.sol --rpc-url chain-rpc-url --private-key your-private-key --sig "run(address)" <vaultAddress> --broadcast
```

### 3. Deposit Tokens

```sh
forge script script/Deposit.s.sol --rpc-url chain-rpc-url --private-key your-private-key --sig "run(address,address,address,address)" <vaultAddress> <erc20Address> <erc721Address> <erc1155Address> --broadcast
```

### 4. Withdraw Tokens

```sh
forge script script/Withdraw.s.sol --rpc-url chain-rpc-url --private-key your-private-key --sig "run(address,address,address,address)" <vaultAddress> <erc20Address> <erc721Address> <erc1155Address> --broadcast
```
